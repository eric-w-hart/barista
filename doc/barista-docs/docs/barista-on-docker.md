title: Building and Running Barista using Docker
sidebar_label: barista-on-docker

While you are free to build and run Barista on your own, we find it easiest to use docker images to manage the process.  Using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), one can get a demo version of Barista up and running in a short time with very few customizations.
The compose configuration will build the application with docker and  run the 5 major components with a single command.
- Postgres Database - stores the state of the application.
- Redis Server - a queue and ephemeral store for inter-server communication.
- barista-web - A web server (nginx) that presents the application to the user's browser and also performs as a reverse proxy for the browser to transact with the API server.
- barista-api - The main processing to manage the state of the application and service the users.
- barista-scan - The engine that takes care of scanning, building, and evaluating the software under test.

While a deployment based on docker-compose is certainly viable for a small instance, it would be a very good idea to use a system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to to manage and schedule the containers.  This gives the administrator finer grained control over things like secrets, resources, and monitoring.  We have built out templates for [Openshift OKD](https://www.okd.io/), contact the authors for more info.

# Barista Source, Build, and Deploy files

This set of files are used to build the application with docker and to deploy the components via docker-compose.  There are a few steps necessary to build the image.
- Download the code from github.
   `git clone https://github.com/optum/Barista.git`
- Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is running on your workstation or server.  Docker version 19.0.3 or greater is preferred, but anything over 18 should work.  (but has not been tested)
  - Be aware that RHEL and CentOs and others may ship earlier versions of docker and not be viable
- Ensure [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed
- Run commands to replace some specific symlinks with actual files.  (only needed if you do not use the pre-built docker images)

    `cd barista;
    rm -fr barista-scan/src/{models,services,shared} &&
    cp -r barista-api/src/{models,services,shared} barista-scan/src;
    `

- check the settings in the file barista-compose.env .  Make modifications as necessary.  (Things like SMTP server, usernames and passwords for internal Git servers, personal access token for public github server if private repos are in play)
- Start the program using docker-compose, wait about 3 minutes for initialization (or watch the logs), then seed with basic data if you wish..

      docker-compose -d  up ;
      sleep 180 ;
      docker-compose exec barista-api yarn db:reset:seed;
- You can watch container logs using "docker logs" command, or use
`docker-compose logs [component]`  (where component is one of barista-api, barista-scan, barista-web, database, redis)

- Point your browser to [http://your_servername/signin] (default username is Admin, password is $barista@admin, all case sensitive)
- Add a project and initiate a scan.  There should be some projects already defined under "Organization", and you can easily add more using the plus button.  (See the [documentation](overview) for more info)
