# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: buildrelease

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
#      - $default-branch
      - 'master'

    # Publish `v1.2.3` tags as releases.
#    tags:
#      - P/*

#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
